# A/B tests for conversion optimization
Learn what resonates with the audience most from the tests data and inject it into the value proposition, ads, features, UX.

**Above-the-fold** testing is a critical component of conversion rate optimization (CRO) for landing pages, as it focuses on the initial user experience within the first few seconds of landing on a page.
 The primary goal is to ensure that the content above the fold effectively captures attention, communicates value, and encourages further engagement, such as scrolling or taking a desired action.
 While traditional best practices often recommend placing the call-to-action (CTA) above the fold for immediate visibility
 , recent evidence suggests that this rule is not universally applicable. For instance, one test demonstrated a 304% increase in conversions when the CTA was placed below the fold, challenging the long-held belief that CTAs must be visible without scrolling.
 This highlights the importance of testing rather than relying on assumptions.

To conduct effective above-the-fold tests, marketers should begin by defining a clear conversion goal—such as sign-ups, downloads, or purchases—and then isolate a single variable for testing, such as headline copy, button color, image choice, or form placement.
 A/B testing is the most essential practice for data-driven optimization, allowing marketers to compare a control version of the page against a variant with specific changes.
 Tools like heatmaps, session replays, and journey analysis can provide qualitative and quantitative data to inform hypotheses, such as identifying low scroll depth or high exit rates on certain elements.
 For example, Ocado used heatmaps to discover that mobile users were clicking on an unclickable hero image and exiting without scrolling, leading to a test that removed the image and improved engagement.

Successful testing also involves considering the entire user journey. While above-the-fold content sets the initial impression and creates an opportunity for conversion, below-the-fold content is responsible for turning that interest into action.
 Therefore, tests should not only focus on the top of the page but also ensure a seamless flow of content that guides users toward the CTA.
 Additionally, incorporating elements like downward arrows or sticky CTAs can encourage scrolling and maintain visibility of key actions throughout the user’s journey.
 Ultimately, the most effective approach is continuous experimentation, as what works for one audience may not work for another, and best practices are fallible.]

### Hero image
A/B test different hero images to see which one converts better. 
- image vs videoloop

### CTA

### Value proposition in the headline

### Trust-Building elements
reviews, testimonials: copies, presentation (carousel vs static)
