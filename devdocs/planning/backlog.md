2. Copy docs to Claude project

3. Copy page docs to v0

4. Let v0 design every pages
(v0 starts breaking up after v10 of any component, so fork it before v10 and continue the editing)

5. Copy all pages code to Claude project

6. start new Nextjs Repl on replit or local environment
Supabase + Nextjs Starter kit boilerplate from Supabase

7. Connect Github

8. Connect cursor with SSH connection.

9. go to cursor. Create all folders and files.

10. Run project on Replit.

11. Paste the code in specific folders.

12. Install all dependencies.

Now you have the frontend code steup.

13. Create backend. use Supabase to create the database, storage and auth.

AI can code you the Database tables, that's the best part.
So go to Supabase, start new project.
Get your keys and paste in env.local file in cursor.

Now you have connected supabase.

8. Ask AI to help you create backend (database tables, storage buckets, auth tables)

Follow the instructions Claude is giving you.

Once you're done. Now you'll have a proper Web app with frontend, backend and sign in sign up functionality. 

9. This is debugging and refinement time. 

Test all features on all pages and use claude + cursor composer to get the debugging work done.

10. Design the landing page.

O1 for content and lauout
V0 for code.
Cursor for assembling code.
Replit to deploy your landing page.

Now you have a Modern Web app with Modern Landing page.

It looks complicated right? But it's not.

It's never been as easy to hard code software before. 

50 days back i didn't know;
- Next js App router 
- database tables
- auth functions
- shadcn Radix
- SSH connection

AI helped me learn coding. Now I can code a proper web app in max 7 days.

Coded 7 projects in last 30 days.

Now my plan is to, not share the business plans but build businesses with AI code.

And sell the projects on Acquire .com or to clients (as I'm doing right now)
