# Landing Page Strategy (cover.me)

## Core Goal
Drive signups, cover letter generations, and resume uploads by job-seekers. Every section and call to action should remove friction and increase conversion to letter generation/export.

---
## Layout Structure
- **Hero**: Trust-building headline + subhead + single CTA ("Generate my cover letter – free")
- **Features**: ATS-friendly output, AI personalization, privacy & security, instant results
- **Preview/Demo**: Live example (job/resume → streaming letter preview)
- **How it works**: 1-2-3 steps visually (upload resume/paste job, review, export)
- **Trust**: Testimonials (real or simulated), recruiter/industry badges
- **FAQ**: Short, focused on privacy/ATS/cost
- **Footer**: Links, privacy/legal, basic contact/social

---
## Copywriting Guidelines
- Focus on speed, simplicity, and job-winning outcomes
- Reassure about privacy—"No data stored beyond what's needed."
- Avoid jargon, but use tech/job-search keywords for SEO
- Keep CTA language strong, direct, benefit-oriented
- Use professional, career-focused tone appropriate for job seekers

---
## SEO/Performance
- Clear and keyword-rich (<title>, meta, H1): “AI Cover Letter Generator,” “Build ATS-Friendly Cover Letters Instantly,” “Upload Resume, Paste Job Description”
- WebP images, lazy loading, mobile-first

---
## Accessibility/ATS Notes
- All navigation/buttons must have ARIA and visible focus
- Demo output should preview plain text ATS-friendly letter (no images, fancy divs)

---
## TODO-REWRITE
Ensure all content, layout, and UX guidelines reflect cover.me’s AI cover letter writer product, not legacy education platform flows.
