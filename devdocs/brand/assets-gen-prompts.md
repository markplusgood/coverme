/**
 * LOGO PROMPT:
 * Create a mystical logo combining an ethereal eye symbol centered within
 * the Seed of Life sacred geometry pattern. The eye should be stylized
 * and abstract, with subtle iris detail. Use violet gradient (from violet #6B21A8 to blue #2563EB).
 * The Seed of Life circles should be delicate line-art, barely visible,
 * creating a mandala-like frame. Include wordmark "mantrika" in Cinzel font below,
 * letterspacing expanded. Proportions follow golden ratio (1:1.618).
 * Style: Minimalist, line-art, spiritual, premium. SVG format.

/**
 * FAVICON PROMPT:
 * Simplified version of main logo - just the eye symbol from the Seed of Life,
 * highly abstracted for 16x16px visibility. Use solid violet (#6B21A8) on
 * transparent background. Ensure the pupil/iris is clearly visible at small size.
 * Create in 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256 sizes. ICO format.

/**
 * ICON SET PROMPT (Lucide-style):
 * Create 8 sacred geometry icons in consistent line-art style:
 * 1. Third Eye (stylized eye with rays)
 * 2. Chakra Lotus (7-petal flower)
 * 3. Merkaba (3D star tetrahedron, line art)
 * 4. Fibonacci Spiral (golden ratio spiral)
 * 5. Metatron's Cube (wireframe)
 * 6. Torus (energy vortex, side view)
 * 7. Sri Yantra (simplified triangle pattern)
 * 8. Vesica Piscis (two overlapping circles)
 * 
 * Style: 24x24px artboard, 2px stroke weight, rounded caps,
 * violet color (#6B21A8) for primary icons, blue (#2563EB) for secondary.
 * Exportable as SVG icons.

/**
 * PATTERN PROMPT (Background Texture):
 * Create seamless tileable pattern featuring:
 * - Flower of Life geometry (overlapping circles)
 * - Very subtle, almost watermark-like opacity (5-10%)
 * - Dual-tone: Violet tint (#6B21A8 at 5%) overlaid with blue hints (#2563EB at 3%)
 * - Pattern repeat: 432px x 432px (432Hz alignment)
 * - Can be layered over light backgrounds (#FAF5FF)
 * 
 * Style: Delicate, ethereal, non-distracting. PNG with transparency.
 * Use: Hero section backgrounds, card overlays, section dividers.

/**
 * GOLDEN RATIO GRID OVERLAY:
 * Design layouts using 1:1.618 proportions:
 * - Hero section: 61.8% image, 38.2% text
 * - Card dimensions: Width = Height × 1.618
 * - Margin relationships: Inner = Outer / 1.618
 * - Column widths follow Fibonacci sequence (13, 21, 34, 55 units)
 */

/**
 * MANDALA DIVIDER PROMPT:
 * Create horizontal section divider featuring:
 * - Central yantra-style mandala (geometric, symmetrical)
 * - Extending line-work on both sides (fades to edges)
 * - Total width: 1200px (scalable), height: 120px
 * - Gradient from violet (#6B21A8) to blue (#2563EB)
 * - Sacred geometry elements: circles, triangles, petals
 * 
 * Style: Ornamental, spiritual, elegant. SVG format.
 * Use: Between major landing page sections.

## Hero Section Design Concepts

Ethereal Gradient Portal - Full-screen vertical gradient from deep violet to celestial gold with a central glowing mandala that pulses subtly, overlaid with bold serif headline and minimalist CTA.
Third Eye Awakening - Centered illustration of an abstract third eye symbol radiating soft light rays, with headline emerging from the center and floating particle effects in the background.
Cosmic Energy Flow - Animated flowing energy streams (Tailwind-animated gradients) moving vertically through the viewport, split-screen with compelling copy on left and visual on right.
Minimalist Chakra Stack - Clean white background with seven subtle chakra symbols vertically aligned on one side, balanced by concise value proposition and prominent signup button.
Astral Plane Depth - Layered parallax effect showing multiple semi-transparent planes (physical, astral, mental) with depth-of-field blur, headline floating in foreground.
Sacred Geometry Grid - Faint geometric patterns (Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube) forming subtle background texture with bold typography and high-contrast CTA button.
Moonlit Meditation - Dark mode hero with crescent moon accent, starfield background, and elegant serif headline suggesting nighttime spiritual practice.
Energy Field Visualization - Abstract representation of human aura/biofield with glowing concentric rings, split layout with testimonial quote and enrollment CTA.
Duotone Mystical Portrait - Large duotone image (violet/gold) of person in meditation pose, overlaid with transparent dark gradient and white text for contrast.
Minimalist Zen Space - Extreme whitespace with single centered headline, tiny accent icon (lotus, eye, star), and solitary bold CTA—emphasizing clarity and focus.
Transformation Journey Path - Horizontal flowing path illustration showing progression stages, with headline at journey start and CTA at the enlightened destination point.
Quantum Field Particles - Animated particle system (CSS/canvas) creating interconnected web of light points, representing consciousness network, with semi-transparent content card overlay.
